## Instructions

### ![EduLink_Server](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/760381c0-c832-4008-930f-7c2e314ed969) Server
No configuration is required for the server to start working immediately.
   
1. **Change Port (Optional):**  
   If you need to change the server's default port:
   - Navigate to ```File > Settings``` in the application menu.
   - Adjust the port number as needed.

### ![EduLink_Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bef07dee-0080-4e06-bff7-217c091d215a) Client

1. **Initial Configuration:**  
    When launching the client for the first time, you will be prompted to configure:
    - **Computer Name:** A unique identifier for your PC that will be shown on the teacher’s interface.
    - **IP Address:** The IP address of the teacher's server (found on the top-right corner of the server window).
    - **Port:** The port number used for communication (matches the server's port).

3. **Accessing EduLink:**
   - After configuration, EduLink will run in the background and can be accessed from the tray icon.
   - Right-click the icon for quick access to features such as settings, shutting down the app, or the current connection to the server.

4. **Admin Permission for Settings:**
   - When trying to access ```Settings```, EduLink will prompt for admin permissions.
   - This ensures that only authorized users (e.g., teachers) can modify important settings, such as IP and port, to maintain the integrity of the connection.
